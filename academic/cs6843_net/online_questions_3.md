Which of the following basic functions is NOT directly supported in IPv6?

- Encapsulation

- Fragmentation and reassembly

- **Detect data transfer error**

- Flow identification

Which of the following basic functions is NOT directly supported by IPv4?

- **Connection control**

- Error control

- Addressing

- Source routing transmission services

Two LANs are interconnected through an Ethernet switch, when packets are exchanged between the two LANs, the switch needs to check both the MAC header and IP header.

- True

- **False**

IPv6 header doesn't keep the flag bit "Donâ€™t Fragment" from IPv4 because

- IPv6 doesn't support fragmentation.

- This bit gets moved to an IPv6 optional extension header.

- Packets carried by IPv6 are too small for further fragmentation.

- **IPv6 fragmentation only occurs at a source host which knows whether the fragmentation is allowed.**

Two LANs are interconnected through an IP router, when packets are exchanged between the two LANs, the router needs to check both the MAC header and IP header.

- **True**

- False

What is the size of an IPv4 header without option fields?

- **20 bytes**

- 24 bytes

- 32 bytes

- 40 bytes

In an IPv4 address, if all the bits in the host part are all 1's, what does that mean?

- It's invalid.

- It's for a specific host address.

- **It's for broadcast in that subnet**

- It's for signaling.

In shortest path routing, the path being calculated between node S and node D must be the minimum-hop path.

- True

- **False**

When a packet arrives at a router, how does the router know which output port the packet should go?

- The router first checks the destination port number in the packet header.

- **The router looks up the forwarding table using the destination address carried by the packet.**

- The output port is pre-determined before the packet arrives.

OSPF (open shortest path first) is based on distance vector routing.

- True

- **False**

With Dijkstra's algorithm, each router must know the complete network topology.

- **True**

- False

Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented to carry distance vector routing.

- True

- **False**

In distance vector routing, each router must know the complete network topology.

- True

- **False**

Link state routing is implemented based on Bellman-Ford algorithm.

- True

- **False**

IP provides global addresses to computers.

- **True**

- False
