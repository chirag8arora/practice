# Review Problem Set 5

#####R4 Suppose two nodes start to transmit at the same time a packet of length L over a broadcast channel of rate R. Denote the propagation delay between the two nodes as d[prop]. Will there be a collision if d[prop] < L/R? Why or why not?

#####R6 In CSMA/CD, after the fifth collision, what is the probability that a node chooses K = 4? The result K = 4 corresponds to a delay of how many seconds on a 10 Mbps Ethernet?

#####R10 Suppose nodes A, B, and C each attach to the same broadcast LAN (through their adapters). If A sends thousands of IP datagrams to B with each encapsulating frame addressed to the MAC address of B, will C’s adapter process these frames? If so, will C’s adapter pass the IP datagrams in these frames to the network layer C? How would your answers change if A sends frames with the MAC broadcast address?

#####R11 Why is an ARP query sent within a broadcast frame? Why is an ARP response sent within a frame with a specific destination MAC address?
