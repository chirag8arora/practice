        - Major feature: 
        - Period created: 
        - Target usage: 
    - BASIC: The beginning of timesharing
        - Major feature: easy to learn and use, friendly, fast turnaround for homework, free and private access, first widely used language with time sharing. 
        - Period created: Designed 1963
        - Target usage: non-science students
    - FORTRAN: Th
        - Major feature: Led to the idea of compiled programming languages. For scientific computations. 
        - Period created: 1957 - Fortran I, 1958 Fortran II, 1960-1962 Fortran IV, 1978 - Fortran 77, Fortran 90, 95, 03, 08
        - Target usage: Scientific computations
    - PL/1
        - Major feature: Scientific computing and business computing
        - Period created: 1963
        - Target usage: Shops need two kinds of computers.
    - PASCAL
        - Major feature: Small, simple, nothing really new
        - Period created: 1971
        - Target usage: Teaching structured programming
    - C
        - Major feature: Powerful set of operators, but poor type checking. 
        - Period created: 1972
        - Target usage: systems programming


2. Computations (BNF, operational, axiomatic and denotational semantic) that are drawn from the development of meta-languages to describe the design of a programming language definition. 
    - draw a parse tree; show left most derivation or right-most derivation; show a grammer is ambiguous; change an operator precedence; convert between BNF and EBNF;
        - parse tree: a hierarchical representation of a derivation
        - a grammer is ambiguous if and only if it generates a sentential form that has two or more distinct parse trees.
        - EBNF: (), [], {}

    - Remove a left-recursion problem;
