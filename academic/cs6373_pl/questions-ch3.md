```
Using the grammar in Example 3.2, show a parse tree and a leftmost derivation for each of the following statements:
a. A = A * (B + (C * A))
b. B = C * (A * C + B)
c. A = A * (B + (C))
```
```
Using the grammar in Example 3.4, show a parse tree and a leftmost derivation for each of the following statements:
a. A = ( A + B ) * C
b. A = B + C + A
c. A = A * (B + C)
d. A = B * (C * (A + B))

```
Prove that the following grammar is ambiguous:
<S> → <A>
<A> → <A> + <A> | <id>
<id> → a | b | c
```
```
Describe, in English, the language defined by the following grammar:
<S> → <A> <B> <C>
<A> → a <A> | a
<B> → b <B> | b
<C> → c <C> | c
```
```
Consider the following grammar:
<S> → <A> a <B> b
<A> → <A> b | b
<B> → a <B> | a
Which of the following sentences are in the language generated by this grammar?
a. baab
b. bbbab
c. bbaaaaa
d. bbaab
```
```
Consider the following grammar:
<S> → a <S> c <B> | <A> | b
<A> → c <A> | c
<B> → d | <A>
Which of the following sentences are in the language generated by this grammar?
a. abcd
b. acccbd
c. acccbcc
d. acd
e. accc
```
```
Write a grammar for the language consisting of strings that have n copies of the letter a followed by the same number of copies of the letter b, where n > 0. For example, the strings ab, aaaabbbb, and aaaaaaaabbbbbbbb are in the language but a, abb, ba, and aaabb are not.
```
```
Convert the following EBNF to BNF:
S → A{bA}
A → a[b]A
```
```
Using the virtual machine instructions given in Section 3.5.1.1, give an operational semantic definition of the following:
a. Java do-while
b. Ada for
c. C++ if-then-else
d. C for
e. C switch
```

constructs and their postconditions:

   {b > 1}
b. if (x < y)
      x = x + 1
   else
      x = 3 * x
